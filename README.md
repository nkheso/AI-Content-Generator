3. **View Output** – The system detects your request type and generates only the relevant output.  
4. **Upload an Image (Optional)** – The AI will describe what’s in the image.

## Run Logging
After each run, the system automatically logs:
- **Prompt** entered by the user.  
- **Output** (text, image URL, or code).  
- **Timestamp** of execution.  

This data is **appended** to a Google Sheet named **"Prompt Testing Log"** in Google Drive, ensuring no previous entries are overwritten.
